# Firmware

- A pre-compiled hex for my personal layout is provided to help kitstart.
- I have decided to not commit basekit-micro to qmk proper since I won't be
making additional versions or PCBs at this point.
- You can find my firmware in a [personal QMK branch here](https://github.com/aadriance/qmk_firmware/tree/basekitmicro/keyboards/basekitmicro)
